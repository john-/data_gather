The 'create_db' file is to generate rrd database.  There migration to postgres under way which will obsolete that approach.

Script to create DB is here but DB will not be specific to data_gather.

sudo su - postgres
psql cart

/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_hba.conf
/etc/postgresql/9.3/main/pg_ident.conf

select input, min(value), max(value) from sensor_history where recorded_at > now() - interval '1 hour' group by input;

\f ''
\o <filename>
select extract(epoch from recorded_at), value from sensor_history where input = 'cpu_temp' and recorded_at >= date '2015-08-01';
\o

gnuplot cpu_temp.plt
